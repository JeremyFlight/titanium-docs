# Using the Debug View

This page describes how to use the Debug View that is part of the Debug perspective.

## Introduction

The Debug View displays all processes that are currently running and debugging targets for the Debug perspective.

Use the Debug View (shown below) to suspend, resume, or terminate the script that you are currently running.

## Instructions

This section describes how to perform common debugging tasks using the Debug View.

### Suspending a thread

To suspend a thread:

1. In the Debug View, select the thread that you want to suspend.

2. Click the **Suspend** button ![IconSuspend](./IconSuspend.png) to suspend the JavaScript code on the first executed line. While the thread is suspended, your web browser user interface will be completely disabled.

After you suspend the thread, you can perform common debugging tasks, such as those listed below:
