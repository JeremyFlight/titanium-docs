# How to report a bug or make a feature request

## Overview

We use [Github Issues](https://github.com/tidev/titanium-sdk/issues) to track bug reports, feature requests or documentation issues.

If you find a bug or need a new feature please go to [New issue](https://github.com/tidev/titanium-sdk/issues/new/choose) and fill out a report. There is also [Github Discussions](https://github.com/tidev/titanium-sdk/discussions) or our [TiDev Slack](https://tidev.slack.com/) for any app related bugs or questions.
