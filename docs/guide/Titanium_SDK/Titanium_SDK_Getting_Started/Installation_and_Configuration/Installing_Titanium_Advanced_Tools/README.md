## Overview

The following packages may be useful for advanced Titanium users, but are not necessary to develop with Titanium.

If you want to build the Titanium SDK from source, or to build native Android modules, you should read this section for software requirements.

### Android Native Development Tools (NDK) (optional)

The Android NDK is required to build native Java/Kotlin modules for Android or to build the Titanium SDK from source.

The NDK is **not** required to build, run, or distribute apps using the Titanium SDK.

If you build a module for the first time the CLI will automatically download a JDK version for you.

See [Installing the Android NDK](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Installing_Titanium_Advanced_Tools/Installing_the_Android_NDK/) for detailed instructions about how to install, including the program location and system environment variables that should be used.
