# Titanium SDK Getting Started

## Overview

This guide walks through the steps of installing and configuring Studio and third-party SDKs and tools required to develop native mobile applications with Studio. If you prefer to use your own editor or IDE, you can integrate the Titanium command-line tools into your environment (see [Setting up the Titanium CLI](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference/) for instructions).

## Prerequisites

Your system environment must meet the following requirements to run Studio:

* **Operating System:** A recent version of Windows or Mac OS X

* **Memory:** 8 GB RAM minimum system memory (2 GB RAM available memory). 16 GB RAM recommended.

* **Java Runtime:** Oracle JDK (no other brand of Java is suitable)

* **Node.js:** Required for the Titanium command-line tools like the CLI, Alloy and AMPLIFY Runtime Services

::: tip ðŸ’¡ Hint
For Windows, you can use either 32-bit or 64-bit versions of Java JDK. Please refer to [Java Support](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix/Studio_Java_Support.html) for more information.
