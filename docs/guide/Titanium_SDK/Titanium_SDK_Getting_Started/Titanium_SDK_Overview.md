# Titanium SDK Overview

Welcome to the Appcelerator Platform! The Appcelerator Platform helps you develop cross-platform mobile applications using the Titanium SDK, Alloy and the Titanium CLI, then lets you manage the entire lifecycle of the application with debugging, testing, deploying, crash monitoring and analytic data collection.

This guide introduces the Appcelerator Platform and walks through the steps of setting up Appcelerator Titanium, downloading and installing the necessary Titanium and third-party SDKs and tools, and creating a simple project.

If you are developing native Android application with Java or native iOS application with Objective-C, see the [AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services Native SDKs](/guide/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/) to get started with integrating Appcelerator Platform services with your application.


## Appcelerator Platform

The Appcelerator Platform consists of several components:

* **[Titanium CLI](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference/)**: tools to create and develop your mobile applications.

* **[Alloy Framework](/guide/Alloy_Framework/)** and the **[Titanium SDK](/guide/Titanium_SDK/)**: an MVC framework and cross-platform SDK to help you rapidly develop mobile applications from a single code base.
