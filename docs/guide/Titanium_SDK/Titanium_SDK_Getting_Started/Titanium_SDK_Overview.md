# Titanium SDK Overview

Welcome to the Titanium Platform! The Titanium Platform helps you develop cross-platform mobile applications using the Titanium SDK, Alloy and the Titanium CLI, then lets you manage the entire lifecycle of the application with debugging, testing and deploying.

This guide introduces the Titanium Platform and walks through the steps of setting up the necessary Titanium and third-party SDKs and tools, and creating a simple project.


## Titanium Platform

The Titanium Platform consists of several components:

* **[Titanium CLI](/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference/)**: tools to create and develop your mobile applications.

* **[Alloy Framework](/guide/Alloy_Framework/)** and the **[Titanium SDK](/guide/Titanium_SDK/)**: an MVC framework and cross-platform SDK to help you rapidly develop mobile applications from a single code base.

* **Extensions for your favorite IDE**: actually, there are extensions for VSCode and Atom.
