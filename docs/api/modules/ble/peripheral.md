<TypeHeader/>

## Overview

The CBPeripheral class represents remote peripheral devices that your app discovers with a central manager (an instance of CentralManager).
In iOS, Peripherals use universally unique identifiers (UUIDs), to identify themselves. For Android, Peripherals use address to be uniqely identified.
Peripherals may contain one or more services or provide useful information about their connected signal strength.
