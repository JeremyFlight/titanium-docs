# Modules.BLE.Beacon

<TypeHeader/>

## Overview

The Beacon class represents a beacon that was observed during beacon ranging. You do not create instances of this class directly. The region manager (RegionManager) object reports observed beacons to its associated delegate object.
The identity of a beacon is defined by its uuid, major, and minor properties. These values are coded into the beacon itself. For a more thorough description of the meaning of those values, see BeaconRegion.
