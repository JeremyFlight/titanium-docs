# Titanium.Stream

<ProxySummary/>

## Overview

This module provides a set of methods for interacting with
[IOStream](Titanium.IOStream) objects, including asynchronous versions of the 
`read` and `write` methods offered by all stream objects. These 
methods should be used in any place where reading from or writing
to a stream might block.
