# Titanium.Network.Socket.UDP

<ProxySummary/>

## Overview

Most socket operations are asynchronous. When you create a socket, you can define
callback functions to receive the results of API calls, as well as to handle incoming
data.

For example, for a client-side socket, you define
[started](Titanium.Network.Socket.UDP.started) and
[error](Titanium.Network.Socket.UDP.error) callback functions.

A familiarity with the basics of BSD socket programming is recommended before using
sockets with Titanium.

Use the [createUDP](Titanium.Network.Socket.createUDP) method to create a UDP socket.
