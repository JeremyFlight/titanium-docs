# Titanium.Module

<ProxySummary/>

## Overview

A Titanium module is a non-createable Titanium object that is exposed through the global Titanium object. For example, the [Titanium.UI](/api/titanium/ui.md) module provides constants and factory methods related to UI objects, as well as a few UI-related properties that are not related to a specific object.
