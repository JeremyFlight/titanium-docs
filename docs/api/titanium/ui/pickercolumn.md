# Titanium.UI.PickerColumn

<ProxySummary/>

## Overview

Use the <Titanium.UI.createPickerColumn> method to create a picker column control. In an Alloy application,
you can use a **`<PickerColumn>`** element inside a `<Picker>` element. You can also use `<Column>`
as a shorthand for `<PickerColumn>` (see Examples).

On Android, the `useSpinner` property must be enabled to support multiple columns.

See <Titanium.UI.Picker> for further examples of usage.
