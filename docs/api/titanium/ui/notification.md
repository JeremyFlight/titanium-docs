# Titanium.UI.Notification

<ProxySummary/>

## Overview

A toast notification is an unobtrusive, pop-up notification that does not
block the UI. Use the [createNotification](Titanium.UI.createNotification) method or **`<Notification>`** Alloy element 
to create a Toast notification.

On Android, by default, a toast notification appears centered on the bottom half of the screen.
On Windows Phone, by default, a toast notification appears over the status bar on the top part
of the screen.
