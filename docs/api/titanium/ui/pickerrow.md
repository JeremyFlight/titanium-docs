# Titanium.UI.PickerRow

<ProxySummary/>

## Overview

Use the [createPickerRow](Titanium.UI.createPickerRow) method to create a picker row control. In an Alloy application,
you can use a **`<PickerRow>`** element inside a `<PickerColumn>` element. You can also use `<Row>`
as a shorthand for `<PickerRow>` (see Examples).

Views added to picker rows is only supported on iOS.
