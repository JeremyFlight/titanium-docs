# Titanium.Android.Calendar

<ProxySummary/>

## Overview

This module supports retrieving information about existing events and creating new events.  
However, modifying or deleting existing events is not yet supported.  
Additionally, recurring events are not yet supported.

Currently, calendar permissions must be explicitly configured in `tiapp.xml` in order to access the
calendar. See "Common Requirements" in
[tiapp.xml and timodule.xml Reference](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/tiapp.xml_and_timodule.xml_Reference).
